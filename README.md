# kd-todo-demo

This is a demo to show off various features of **Knockdown** that have been raised in [the Knockout community](https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/2106#issuecomment-629771671) as being desirable in a next gen MVVM library.

The techniques displayed should neither be considered idiomatic nor has this demo been prepared for a production environment.

### Note: Knockdown is currently in a privately hosted alpha state.

NPM/Yarn will not be able to install it if you clone this repo.

If you would like to provide feedback to help its development or gain access to the repository, then [join the community at discourse.knockdown.dev](https://discourse.knockdown.dev).
